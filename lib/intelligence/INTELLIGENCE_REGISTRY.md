# Intelligence Registry™

**Internal only — never user-facing.**

Blueprint for the ADHD Business Ecosystem™. When a new intelligence engine ships in two or five years, the question is not "What data do we need?" but "Which registered objects does it enrich, and which hooks already exist?"

Maintain this document when adding **object types**, **storage keys**, or **intelligence engines**.

---

## The standard

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Build once. Enrich forever.** | Same object evolves (thought → task → project). No duplication. |
| **Relationships over content** | Store edges, lineage, confidence — not only text fields. |
| **Invisible evolution** | Users use the companion; intelligence compounds quietly. |
| **Hooks today, engines tomorrow** | Optional fields in V1; engines consume them later without migrations. |

Shared hook shape: `lib/intelligence/intelligenceReadyTypes.ts` → `IntelligenceReadyHooks`

```ts
id, createdAt, updatedAt?,
originatedFromId, originatedFromKind?,
connectionIds?,           // Living Intelligence Graph™
intelligenceMeta?         // per-engine enrichments — never bulk-expose in UI
```

---

## Sprint gate (every feature)

1. What is this object?
2. What relationships might it eventually have?
3. Which intelligence engines could benefit?
4. What metadata should exist now even if unused?
5. Will this support features we have not imagined?

If any answer is "unknown" — redesign before shipping.

## Relationship map (high level)

```
Thought ──collection──► Collection
   │                        │
   ├──projectId──────────► Project ──items──► ProjectItem
   ├──connectedPerson───► Relationship (string today; id future)
   ├──reminderAt────────► Reminder / TimeBlock
   ├──connectionIds─────► LIG edges (future typed connections)
   └──originatedFrom────► Thought | Conversation | … (evolution lineage)

Conversation ──signals──► IntelligenceSignal ──► all engines
FounderEvent ──refs──────► Project | Thought | Workspace
```

**Evolution without duplication:** `originatedFromId` + `originatedFromKind` when a thought becomes a project item, decision, or content draft.

## Adding a new object (checklist)

- [ ] Add row to **Object registry** above
- [ ] Extend `EcosystemObjectKind` in `intelligenceReadyTypes.ts` if new kind
- [ ] Type includes `IntelligenceReadyHooks` fields (or subset with comment)
- [ ] Document storage key and ingest/event hook
- [ ] List which engines **read** vs **write**
- [ ] V1 UI uses only user-facing fields
- [ ] No second table for the same conceptual thing

---

## Adding a new intelligence engine (checklist)

- [ ] Add row to **Intelligence engine registry**
- [ ] Add `IntelligenceEngineId` key
- [ ] Declare which objects it reads (registry rows)
- [ ] Declare write target: `intelligenceMeta.<engine>` and/or signal bus
- [ ] Never require users to re-enter or reconnect existing data
- [ ] Ship behind calm surface — Intelligence Paradox™
