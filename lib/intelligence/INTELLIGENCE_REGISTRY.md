# Intelligence Registry

**Internal only — never user-facing.**

Blueprint for the ADHD Business Ecosystem™. When a new intelligence engine ships in two or five years, the question is not "What data do we need?" but "Which registered objects does it enrich, and which hooks already exist?"

Maintain this document when adding **object types**, **storage keys**, or **intelligence engines**.

---

## The standard

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Build once. Enrich forever.** | Same object evolves (thought → task → project). No duplication. |
| **Relationships over content** | Store edges, lineage, confidence — not only text fields. |
| **Invisible evolution** | Users use the companion; intelligence compounds quietly. |
| **Hooks today, engines tomorrow** | Optional fields in V1; engines consume them later without migrations. |

Shared hook shape: `lib/intelligence/intelligenceReadyTypes.ts` → `IntelligenceReadyHooks`

```ts
id, createdAt, updatedAt?,
originatedFromId, originatedFromKind?,
connectionIds?,           // Living Intelligence Graph
intelligenceMeta?         // per-engine enrichments — never bulk-expose in UI
```

---

## Sprint gate (every feature)

1. What is this object?
2. What relationships might it eventually have?
3. Which intelligence engines could benefit?
4. What metadata should exist now even if unused?
5. Will this support features we have not imagined?

If any answer is "unknown" — redesign before shipping.

## Spark OS foundational layers

| Layer | Spec | Role | Implementation (when wired) |
|-------|------|------|----------------------------|
| **Business Asset System™** | [002](../spark-intelligence-foundation/002-business-asset-architecture.md) | What members build — living objects | `business-asset` kind + future asset store |
| **Business Brain™** | [003](../spark-intelligence-foundation/003-business-brain.md) | Long-term business memory — remembers, does not decide | [009-lifecycle](../spark-intelligence-foundation/009-business-brain-lifecycle.md) · **[Spec 117](../docs/SPARK_BUSINESS_BRAIN_MEMORY_RETRIEVAL_FRAMEWORK.md)** · **[Spec 118](../docs/SPARK_HIDDEN_WORK_ENGINE_FRAMEWORK.md)** · `lib/sparkBusinessBrain/` · `memoryEngine/` |
| **Spark Knowledge Model™** | [004](../spark-intelligence-foundation/004-spark-knowledge-model.md) | Nine knowledge categories, confidence, ownership | `lib/sparkKnowledgeModel/types.ts` |
| **Guidance Engine™** | [005](../spark-intelligence-foundation/005-guidance-engine.md) | Reasons and recommends; member owns decisions | `lib/sparkGuidanceEngine/types.ts` |
| **Spark Response Architecture™** | [006](../spark-intelligence-foundation/006-spark-response-architecture.md) | Runtime pipeline — all interactions must flow through | `lib/sparkResponseArchitecture/types.ts` · `lib/sparkTrustPerformance/` |
| **Context Strategy™ & MVC** | [007](../spark-intelligence-foundation/007-context-strategy.md) | Intelligent context selection; six tiers; budgets | `lib/sparkContextStrategy/types.ts` |
| **Interaction Contracts™** | [008](../spark-intelligence-foundation/008-interaction-contracts.md) | One owner per responsibility; published contracts only | `lib/sparkInteractionContracts/types.ts` |

**Brain invariant:** retrieve context before re-asking; never generate content, recommendations, or member-facing copy; lifecycle stages govern storage; MVC governs retrieval ([009](../spark-intelligence-foundation/009-business-brain-lifecycle.md)).

**Knowledge invariant:** every record should declare `SparkKnowledgeCategory` + `SparkKnowledgeConfidence`; connect to Business Assets where applicable.

**Guidance invariant:** offers possibilities, never commands; reads Brain/Assets/Knowledge; Companion composes language.

**Response invariant:** no feature bypasses the 10-stage lifecycle; learning never blocks helping (Stage 10 async).

**Context invariant:** MVC only — never load entire Brain/Graph/Gallery; stop when sufficient confidence; Phase 1 blocks, Phases 2–3 async.

**Contract invariant:** systems never mutate peer internal state; only Companion speaks to the member; resolve ownership conflicts before shipping.

## Adding a new object (checklist)

- [ ] Add row to **Object registry** above
- [ ] Extend `EcosystemObjectKind` in `intelligenceReadyTypes.ts` if new kind
- [ ] Type includes `IntelligenceReadyHooks` fields (or subset with comment)
- [ ] Document storage key and ingest/event hook
- [ ] List which engines **read** vs **write**
- [ ] V1 UI uses only user-facing fields
- [ ] No second table for the same conceptual thing

---

## Adding a new intelligence engine (checklist)

- [ ] Add row to **Intelligence engine registry**
- [ ] Add `IntelligenceEngineId` key
- [ ] Declare which objects it reads (registry rows)
- [ ] Declare write target: `intelligenceMeta.<engine>` and/or signal bus
- [ ] Never require users to re-enter or reconnect existing data
- [ ] Ship behind calm surface — Intelligence Paradox
