# P0-01 — Chamber Knowledge Retrieval Wiring Report

**Date:** 2026-07-22  
**Mission:** Wire approved Chamber knowledge libraries into the existing Chamber / companion-chat retrieval path.  
**Hard rules honored:** No parallel RAG system · frozen conversation architecture · extend `lib/chamber/` + existing `chamberMemberHintForChat` → `intentHint` path.

**Continuation (Knowledge member):** [P0_01B_KNOWLEDGE_CHAMBER_RETRIEVAL_WIRING_REPORT.md](./P0_01B_KNOWLEDGE_CHAMBER_RETRIEVAL_WIRING_REPORT.md)

## Design notes

1. **No parallel retrieval:** Loader selects paths + injects structured contracts into the existing Chamber hint. Events continues to own planning runtime in `lib/eventsIntelligence/`.
2. **Thin-line preserved:** Contracts encode owns / does-not-own / safety / production rules; Shari still composes the visible reply.
3. **Filesystem verification:** Tests prove CR / Knowledge selected docs exist on disk; chat path skips fs checks at runtime (paths are authority references for the model).
4. **Next libraries:** Add folder under `docs/chamber-knowledge/`, contract module, and registry seed — same pattern as CR / Knowledge.
5. **Knowledge detail:** See P0-01B — browser **NOT_RUN** → production **NOT_CERTIFIED**.

## Test evidence

```
npx vitest run lib/chamber/knowledge/chamberKnowledgeRetrieval.test.ts lib/chamber/chamberMemberPrompt.test.ts
→ 28 passed (2 files) — includes Knowledge suite (P0-01B)
```

## Honest remaining gaps

- Full markdown bodies are not streamed into every turn (by design — contract + path authority).
- Architecture packs for unwired members remain product-completion docs until each member gets a library + contract.
- Events advanced ops (433–438) still not certified; bridge is partial by intent.
- Knowledge: no `docs/chamber-knowledge/knowledge/` founder library yet; browser validation pending (P0-01B).
- Red-team suite 429 not implemented as a green CI suite.
