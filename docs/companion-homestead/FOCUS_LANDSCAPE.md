## Master Insight

> You are building a cognitive landscape where ADHD attention can move safely between states of mind.

Each space is **not a screen**. Each space is a **place the brain enters** depending on what it needs.

No menus. Only movement through land.

## Six Spaces

| Space | Feeling / Tool | Homestead place | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Garden Path** | I'm Stuck | `garden-path` | One visible next action |
| **Meadow / Lake** | I Need a Break (hub) | `sunroom-over-pond` | Downshift overload |
| **Forest Clearing** | Stretch, Calm Moment | `garden` | Physical release |
| **Forest Pavilion** | All audio tools | `greenhouse` | Sound without visual stimulation |
| **Meadow Object Field** | Brain break games | `garden` | Gentle dopamine reset |
| **Horizon Trail** | Walk reminder | `outlook-point` | Real-world motion |
| **Deep Forest** | Sensory reset | `garden-path` (fog profile) | Complete downshift |

---

## Tool Routing

Every Focus hub tool maps to a landscape space via `FOCUS_TOOL_TO_SPACE` in `lib/focusLandscape/toolRouting.ts`. Components never hardcode destinations.

---

## Global Rules

1. **Environment first, interface second**
2. **Living Border** — all meaningful motion at edges
3. **No competing motion behind text**
4. **Shari Nearby or ambient** — never central in Focus
5. **Transitions = movement through land** — walk, terrain shift, weather — never modal or load screen

Enforced: `FOCUS_LANDSCAPE_GLOBAL_RULES` · `FOCUS_LANDSCAPE_FORBIDDEN`

## Pipeline

```
FocusAreaPanel
  → evaluateFocusLandscape({ workspaceId, focusCategoryId, toolId })
  → placeId + css vars + data-focus-landscape-space
  → SceneRenderer → LivingBorderFrame
```

`focus-hub` → Meadow/Lake center  
`focus-category` + `stuck` → Garden Path  
`focus-category` + `need-break` → Meadow/Lake  
Individual tools → subspaces per routing table

## Relationship to Sunroom Over The Pond

Meadow/Lake uses `sunroom-over-pond` as its homestead place — the pond/lake horizon is the emotional anchor for break and regulation. Garden Path and other spaces use their own place compositions.
