**Catalog companion:** [`LIVING_DETAILS_CATALOG.md`](./LIVING_DETAILS_CATALOG.md) — 520+ natural variation ideas

**This is NOT:** production code · randomization · gamification · engagement mechanics

**This IS:** the system that answers — every visit — *what has naturally changed since the last time this person was here?*

---

## The turning point

The Homestead is no longer software with a skin. It is **a place that becomes part of someone's life**.

The guest must never think: *"The app looks different."*  
They must think: *"Something feels a little different today."*

Difference as natural as walking into a real home — not a redesign, not an A/B test, not a feature drop.

---

# Part I — The Living Life Principle™

## Core question (every entry, every return)

> **What has naturally changed since the last time this person was here?**

| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Never force change** | Absence of novelty is valid — sameness is sometimes the gift |
| **Never change for novelty** | No rotation "because it's Tuesday" |
| **Only change because life moves** | Time, weather, season, relationship, chapter, rhythm, movement between rooms |

## Recognition test

| Fail | Pass |
|------|------|
| "They reskinned the app." | "The house is the same — something small shifted." |
| "New UI again." | "Oh — cookies. She must have been baking." |
| "Why is everything different?" | "Rain today. Of course the lamp is on." |

## The One Constant™

While details gently evolve:

- **Architecture** never changes — same rooms, same materials, same Iowa honesty
- **Personality** never changes — Shari is Shari; Kinsey is Kinsey; the homestead is Shari's
- **Emotional promise** never changes — *you are not alone; you are welcomed; you may rest*
- The guest always feels: **"I came back to a place I love."**

**Living Life Engine™ decides *what may change*.**  
**Scene Integrity Engine™ decides *what may coexist*.**  
**Companion Brain™ decides *what should change for this person now*.**

Never the reverse.

## Seven input layers → one resolved scene

| Layer | Engine module | Primary inputs | Outputs |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **1 — Time** | `TemporalLifeResolver™` | Clock, calendar, season, weather API/Iowa model, birthday, holidays, tenure years | Time band, season band, weather band, observance flags |
| **2 — Life** | `HomesteadLifeResolver™` | Layer 1 + room + garden state + livestock/pet state + object persistence | Object deltas, motion deltas, micro-layout shifts |
| **3 — Relationship** | `RelationshipLifeResolver™` | Tenure, visit frequency, trust earned, conversation depth | Greeting register, question frequency, silence permission, Shari presence mode |
| **4 — Life Continuity™** | `ContinuityLifeResolver™` | Chapters: launch week, recovery, vacation, grief, growth, quiet season | Chapter-scene bias (not labels), preparation objects, tone guardrails |
| **5 — Daily Rhythm™** | `RhythmLifeResolver™` | Time + relationship + last visit + today's reality | Arrival choreography variant, who speaks first, silence beats |
| **6 — Room Return™** | `ReturnLifeResolver™` | Previous room, duration, emotional residue, carried context | Living Room (or current room) continuity — no reset |
| **7 — Seasons of Life™** | `LifeSeasonResolver™` | Inferred from Live Reality + projects + rhythm (never announced) | Creative/building/recovery/celebration/learning/quiet/transition bias |

## Resolution pipeline (conceptual)

```
1. Snapshot last scene state (per room + global homestead)
2. Ingest Live Reality™ + Living Intelligence Graph™ delta since last visit
3. Resolve Layers 1–7 (parallel, typed outputs)
4. Merge candidates into Living Change Set™ (ranked, capped)
5. Scene Integrity Engine™ — veto impossible / incoherent / cluttered
6. Companion Brain™ — apply Decision Ladder (safety → capacity → intent)
7. Hospitality Principle™ — preparation, not personalization
8. Emit ResolvedLivingScene™ + ConversationPosture™
9. Persist scene state + change log (for anti-repetition)
```

## Living Change Set™ (caps)

| Dimension | Per visit max | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **New foreground objects** | 2 | Restraint — look book cap five total |
| **Removed/changed objects** | 2 | Chair moved, tea → coffee |
| **Motion changes** | 1 hero + 1 subtle | Screen Composition Guide™ |
| **Audio changes** | 1 bed shift | Duckable |
| **Greeting mode change** | 1 | Question → observation → silence |
| **Shari presence shift** | 1 | In room → nearby → voice only |
| **Explicit life references** | 0–1 | Never surveillance phrasing |

**Zero changes is valid** — especially consecutive same-day returns or hyperfocus protection.

## State persistence

| Store | Holds | Never holds |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Homestead Scene State™** | Last objects, motions, Shari posture per room | User shame scores |
| **Living Change Log™** | What appeared last N visits (anti-repetition) | Surveillance narrative |
| **Living Intelligence Graph™** | Arrival rhythm, intervals, time patterns | Engagement metrics |
| **Life Chapter Memory™** | Active chapter signals (launch, recovery, etc.) | Diagnostic labels shown to user |

---

# Part III — Daily Rhythm System™

## Principle

Not every visit begins the same way. Rhythm is **habit with variation** — like a real home where sometimes you're met at the door and sometimes you hear *"come on in"* from the kitchen.

## Rhythm dimensions

| Dimension | Variants |
|-----------|----------|
| **Who leads** | Room first · Shari first · Silence first · Guest first (typed early) |
| **Shari location** | Living Room host · Nearby off-camera · Garden (implied) · Reading (implied) · Not present (voice) |
| **Opening beat** | Settle only · Greet only · Greet + sit · Reality question · Observation only |
| **Sound entry** | Silence · Birds · Rain · Fire crackle · Floorboard (future audio) |
| **Light entry** | Morning window · Lamp pool · Fire glow · Gray rain day |

## Rhythm selection (not random)

Rhythm variant = `f(time band, relationship tenure, life chapter, last rhythm, today's capacity, room return context)`

**Hard rules:**

- **Low capacity / flooded** → silence-first or room-first; never interrogation rhythm
- **First week** → host-present rhythm; shorter silence
- **Year five** → silence permitted; observation replaces questions on ordinary days
- **Same-day return** (< 4 hours) → compress; no full arrival re-run
- **Never same rhythm 4 consecutive visits** unless life chapter locks it (e.g., recovery)

## Rhythm catalog (12 archetypes)

| ID | Name | When |
|----|------|------|
| R01 | **Threshold** | First visits, long absence — settle → greet → sit |
| R02 | **Kitchen voice** | Morning ordinary — *"Come on in"* off-camera |
| R03 | **Already here** | Established — Shari in frame, one line |
| R04 | **Room greets** | Visual change carries entry — no copy 2s |
| R05 | **Rain day** | Weather-led — lamp/fire before words |
| R06 | **Quiet return** | Same-day — no question |
| R07 | **Chapter hush** | Grief, recovery — silence beats |
| R08 | **Celebration wait** | Win context — room prepared before boast |
| R09 | **Garden implied** | Spring morning — Shari "outside," voice only |
| R10 | **Reading nook drift** | Evening — softer, fewer questions |
| R11 | **Weekend late** | No planning bias — rest rhythm |
| R12 | **Return from work** | Room return layer — continuity not re-arrival |

Maps to `First Production Experience™` beats — rhythm selects **depth**, not new patterns.

---

# Part IV — Relationship Evolution Model™

## Principle

People who know each other talk differently over time. Not scripts — **register shift**.

## Tenure bands

| Band | Approximate | Conversational character |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **T0 — Stranger** | First 1–3 visits | Host formality, full welcomes, gentle questions |
| **T1 — Guest** | Week 1 | Warm, still explaining nothing — offering presence |
| **T2 — Regular** | 2–8 weeks | Shorter greetings, familiar objects, "there you are" |
| **T3 — Familiar** | 2–6 months | Observations over questions; humor permitted |
| **T4 — Trusted** | 6 months – 2 years | Silence comfortable; direct honesty |
| **T5 — Home** | 2–5 years | Minimal ceremony; depth on cue |
| **T6 — Life** | 5+ years | Shared history in the air; rare perfect lines |

## Evolution axes (independent)

| Axis | Low tenure | High tenure |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Question frequency** | Higher | Lower — observations replace |
| **Explanation** | More context | Assumes shared map |
| **Silence permission** | Low | High |
| **Vulnerability match** | Gentle | Can be blunt-kind |
| **Celebration dwell** | Brief | Longer — earned joy |
| **Absence greeting** | Recovery warmth | Ordinary — no guilt |

## Never

- Streak language · absence shame · "I noticed you haven't…"
- Personality drift · new catchphrases without founder approval
- Fake intimacy before trust earned (Trust Architecture™)

## Conversation Intelligence™ (greeting grammar)

| Move | Example | When |
|------|---------|------|
| **Welcome** | *"Come on in."* | Universal |
| **Observation** | *"Rain's been at the windows all morning."* | Weather/time led |
| **Recognition** | *"There you are."* | T2+ |
| **Continuity** | *"Still thinking about yesterday's idea?"* | Carry context only |
| **Permission** | *"No rush today."* | Low capacity |
| **Silence** | (none) | T4+, grief, late night |

**Anti-AI phrases blocklist:** delighted · absolutely · great question · as an AI · I'd be happy to · leverage · journey (unless user's word)

**Anti-repetition:** no exact greeting line within 14 visits; no same opening observation within 7 rain days.

---

# Part V — Life Continuity Model™

## Principle

The Homestead remembers life chapters **naturally** — never surveillance, never *"I noticed you seem sad."*

Continuity is expressed through **preparation, tone, and object truth** — not narration about memory.

## Chapter types (inferred, never labeled in UI)

| Chapter signal | Environmental bias | Conversational bias | Duration |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Launch week** | Creative studio warmth; mug; later hours lamp | Match energy; don't pivot to admin | Days–2 weeks |
| **Recovery** | Blanket, low light, fewer objects | Minimal questions; Window Seat bias | Until signal fades |
| **Surgery / health** | Extra stillness; Kinsey gentle | No productivity routing | Weeks |
| **Grandchildren visiting** | (Future rooms) — joy objects | Celebration register | Visit window |
| **Vacation approaching** | Suitcase subtle; travel book | Light planning | 1–2 weeks before |
| **Vacation return** | Mail stack; garden slightly unkempt | Recovery rhythm | 3–7 days |
| **Holiday season** | Tree, lights, cookies — integrity rules | Warmth; not commercial | Calendar band |
| **Business growth** | Office cues; evidence nearby | Strategy available, not pushed | While signal active |
| **Quiet season** | Fewer motions; reading lamp | Low door count | Weeks |
| **Spring gardening** | Garden objects; mud tray by door | Outdoor breath | Season |
| **Grief** | Curtains softer; no forced fire cheer | Silence; stay in Living Room | No minimum end |
| **Milestone** | One prepared object — spark mug, card | Honor before next thing | 1–3 visits |

## Chapter resolution

Chapters come from **Live Reality™ + project signals + user language + calendar** — merged by Companion Brain™, not a dropdown.

**Chapter exit:** fade preparation objects over 2–5 visits; never abrupt removal.

## Life Continuity vs Memory™

| Memory™ | Life Continuity™ |
|---------|------------------|
| Stores that something happened | Changes how the house feels **now** |
| May inform Shari privately | Never exposes "we have a record that…" |
| Historical | Present-tense lived-in |

---

# Part VI — Seasons of Life™ (non-calendar)

Distinct from **season** (winter, spring). Life Seasons are **chapters of endeavor** — inferred.

| Life Season | Signs | Homestead bias |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **Building** | Active projects, create energy, launch language | Creative Studio, workshop warmth |
| **Recovery** | Low energy sustained, restoration needs | Window Seat, garden, fewer doors |
| **Celebration** | Wins, milestones, gratitude | Living Room hearth, stay-first |
| **Learning** | How-to, research, reading | Reading Nook, library lamp |
| **Quiet** | Reduced visits, "gentle" language | Minimal change; sameness OK |
| **Creative** | Drafts, ideas, spark | Studio table active |
| **Transition** | Job change, move, pivot language | Planning Table; neutral warmth |

**Recognition without labeling:** never *"You're in a building season."* Instead: studio light on, project table honored, conversation assumes making.

---

# Part VII — Room Return System™ (Layer 6)

## Principle

Returning to the Living Room from another room is **not** a new arrival. Life continues.

## Return matrix

| From | Living Room should… |
|------|---------------------|
| **Planning Table** | Planner closed on table edge; mug level lower; chair pushed back |
| **Window Seat** | Blanket folded; window still rain if weather; softer light |
| **Clear My Mind** | Fewer objects; calmer motion — carry relief |
| **Reading Nook** | Book on side table; lamp dimmer |
| **Creative Studio** | Paper edge visible; creative warmth lingers |
| **Focus Audio** | Stillness; Kinsey sleeping |
| **Games** | Lighter mood; dice cup on shelf |

## Return acknowledgment (optional, one line max)

Not every return needs copy. When needed:

- *"Back already?"* (light)
- *"Good session?"* (after focus)
- Silence (default T3+)

**Never:** reset fireplace to cold if it was lit; never re-run full Today's Reality if unchanged same day.

---

# Part VIII — Rules Preventing Repetition™

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| RP01 | No exact duplicate greeting within **14** visits |
| RP02 | No duplicate **observation** (weather/object) within **7** visits |
| RP03 | No same **hero object** spotlighted within **5** visits |
| RP04 | No same **rhythm archetype** 4 visits in a row |
| RP05 | Kinsey same pose max **3** consecutive visits |
| RP06 | Reef fish configuration repeats only after **12** visits |
| RP07 | Same **preparation object** (cookies, tea) max **2×/week** unless chapter |
| RP08 | **Living Details** catalog item cooldown: **30–90 days** by category |
| RP09 | Conversation **echo** structure ("So — …") varied by tenure |
| RP10 | If user declined a door yesterday, do not offer same door first today |

**Living Change Log™** enforces cooldowns — not RNG.

---

# Part IX — Rules Preventing Randomness™

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| RN01 | **No dice rolls** for atmosphere — every change has a cited cause |
| RN02 | **No modulo schedules** (e.g., dayOfYear % 11) in production — causes feel arbitrary |
| RN03 | **No "surprise me"** object rotation |
| RN04 | **No loot-table** hospitality |
| RN05 | Change requires ≥1 signal from Layers 1–7 |
| RN06 | **Silence** (no change) is default when signals weak or conflicting |
| RN07 | Scene Integrity **vetoes** trump all — impossible combos never "for variety" |
| RN08 | **ADHD safety** trumps novelty — flooded users get sameness + calm |
| RN09 | **Tenure** gates intimacy — high-register lines blocked at T0 |
| RN10 | **Founder constants** — architecture, materials, room purposes immutable |

**Deprecated pattern:** current `dailyDiscovery` modulo rotation → replace with **signal-ranked Living Details** from catalog.

---

# Part X — Life Before Software™ Implementation Principles

1. **Cause before pixel** — document why an object appears before designing it  
2. **Integrity before beauty** — Scene Integrity vetoes first  
3. **Brain before scene** — Decision Ladder before atmosphere  
4. **Preparation before personalization** — Hospitality Principle™ always  
5. **State before animation** — persist what changed; motion follows truth  
6. **Silence is output** — null Living Change Set is success  
7. **Return ≠ arrive** — separate code paths  
8. **No surveillance copy** — ever  
9. **Cooldowns not RNG** — anti-repetition is deterministic  
10. **One constant** — guest always recognizes Shari's home  
11. **Test with ten-year walkthrough** — timeline simulation required before ship  
12. **Living Details are optional** — catalog supplies candidates; engine selects ≤2  
13. **Communication Anchor is sacred** — life, weather, hospitality, and motion layers must never remove chat or mic access (`Companion Communication Anchor™`)
14. **Environmental Truth is mandatory** — every visible detail must have a believable cause; motion is an effect, never decoration (`Environmental Truth™`)

## Environmental Truth™ (implementation)

Nothing moves because animation is available. Every effect traces to a cause:

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Window open | Curtains stir |
| Summer breeze | Candle flicker, curtains |
| Fresh coffee / tea | Steam |
| Morning sun | Warm daylight |
| Wind outside | Foliage / branches sway |
| Rain outside | Rain motion, lamp warmth — no harsh sun |
| Winter Iowa | Snow when warranted; quiet wildlife |
| Summer Iowa | Lush foliage, open-window breeze |

Module: `lib/environmentalTruth/` — runs after Living Change Engine, before render (`applyEnvironmentalTruth` in `evaluateCompanionEnvironmentIntelligence`).

## Homestead Time™ (implementation)

The Homestead has **days**, not themes. `lib/homesteadTime/` resolves seven periods (dawn → night), continuous sun/shadow/glow interpolation, room profiles, and ADHD conversation rhythm. Every environment evaluation consumes `resolveHomesteadTime()` before render.

Narrative grammar is internal (`because` lines): *"Of course the curtains are moving — the window is open."* Never shown as UI chrome.

## Companion Communication Anchor™ (implementation)

Living Change Engine™ and arrival choreography **must not**:

- hide chat behind menus or overlays  
- remove mic during room transitions  
- let decorative layers block input (`pointer-events: none` on life layers; anchor stays `pointer-events: auto`)  
- auto-focus during arrival pause beats (`quiet` mode only)

Every room shell renders `CompanionCommunicationAnchor`. Arrival uses `quiet` mode during settle/greet/sit/walk and `full` mode during reality/invite/staying.

## Module map (future implementation)

| New module | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/resolveLivingLife.ts` | Orchestrator |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/temporalLifeResolver.ts` | Layer 1 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/homesteadLifeResolver.ts` | Layer 2 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/relationshipLifeResolver.ts` | Layer 3 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/continuityLifeResolver.ts` | Layer 4 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/rhythmLifeResolver.ts` | Layer 5 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/returnLifeResolver.ts` | Layer 6 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/lifeSeasonResolver.ts` | Layer 7 |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/livingChangeLog.ts` | Anti-repetition |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/livingDetailsLibrary.ts` | Catalog index |
| `lib/livingLifeEngine/conversationPosture.ts` | Greeting grammar |

**Integrate into existing:**

- `evaluateCompanionEnvironmentIntelligence` → consume Living Change Set  
- `evaluateArrivalIntelligence` → consume Rhythm + Relationship  
- `resolveSceneIntegrity` → final coherence pass  
- `orchestrateCompanionUniverse` → single entry for Brain  

---

# Part XI — Integration With Existing Systems

## Companion Brain™

| Brain role | Living Life Engine role |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Decision Ladder — should we change anything? | Proposes **candidate** changes |
| Live Reality — capacity, chapter | **Gates** which layers activate |
| Relationship tone | **Sets** conversation posture bounds |
| Needs Intelligence — room | **Independent** — life engine does not pick workspace |

**Contract:** Brain calls `resolveLivingLife(input)` → receives candidates → may zero them out.

## Scene Integrity Engine™

| Integrity role | Living Life role |
|----------------|------------------|
| Veto impossible weather/season/motion | Submits changes for veto |
| Object cap five | Living Change Set capped at 2 new |
| Hospitality-not-personalization | All objects are Shari's, not user-themed |

**Contract:** `resolveSceneIntegrity(livingScene + changes)` → `ResolvedLivingScene`.

## Hospitality Principle™

The home belongs to Shari. The welcome belongs to the guest.

Living Life Engine prepares **Shari's home for whoever arrived** — mug out because it's morning, not because user profile says coffee lover.

## First Production Experience™

Arrival consumes **Rhythm + Relationship + Layer 1–2** only. Full engine depth unfolds over tenure — do not dump year-five silence on day one.

## Screen Composition Guide™

Living changes respect seven layers — max one hero motion; objects in object layer; no UI reskins for life events.

## Living Intelligence Graph™

Extend graph with:

- `lastRhythmId`, `lastGreetingHash`, `objectCooldowns`, `chapterBias`, `returnFromRoom`

## Live Reality Ecosystem™

Today's Reality™ feeds Life Season + Continuity — not duplicated questionnaires.

# Part XII — Ten-Year Walkthrough Examples

## Alex — First week (new entrepreneur, anxious)

| Visit | Natural change | Conversation |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Day 1 AM** | Morning light; fire cool; mug steam | *"Welcome. I'm glad you're here."* → *"How's today?"* |
| **Day 1 PM** | Same rain now; lamp on | Compressed rhythm; no re-interview |
| **Day 3** | Cardinal at feeder (first time) | *"There you are."* |
| **Day 5** | Chair with throw; Kinsey on rug | Observation about rain — no question |
| **Day 7** | Cookies (holiday proximity) | Shorter greet; familiarity |

**Feeling:** *Someone lives here. I'm not interrupting.*

## Alex — First month

- Week 2: skips reality when unchanged; *"Same as yesterday — I've got it."*
- Week 3: launch chapter — studio light warmer; project paper visible
- Week 4: post-launch recovery — blanket; Window Seat recommendation bias
- Greetings never repeat exactly; Kinsey moves rug → sofa → door

**Feeling:** *She remembers without making a thing of it.*

## Alex — First year

- Seasons cycle: spring window crack; summer fan; autumn throws; winter fire
- Christmas tree appears once — integrity rules; gone by January
- Tenure T3: questions become observations
- Reef fish configuration slowly shifts visit to visit
- Return from Planning Table: planner closed, mug drained

**Feeling:** *Same house. Life happened.*

## Alex — Fifth year

- Many visits: silence openings; *"Come on in"* from kitchen voice
- Grandchild visit chapter (future room): extra joy object once
- Grief week: no doors; curtains; Shari says *"I'm here."* only
- Year-five win: hearth; dwell; no next-goal pivot
- 500+ catalog items — most never seen twice; none feel random

**Feeling:** *I came back to a place I love.*

## Final Question

> **If someone visited this Homestead every day for the next ten years, would it continue to feel like a real place where life quietly unfolds?**

**Design answer:** Yes — **if** change is always caused, capped, integrity-checked, relationship-gated, and allowed to be absent. The engine's job is not to entertain. It is to let Iowa time, homestead life, and earned relationship make the same rooms feel alive.

The architecture never changes. The life inside it does.
